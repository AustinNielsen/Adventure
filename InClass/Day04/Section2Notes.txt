Inheritance:

What to do if you want to extend:
-Add the extends keyword
-Add super() as the first line of constructor. Unless the superclass has a no parameter constructor.
-Make everything thing in the superclass public or protected if it needs to be accesseod



Definitions:
-Superclass or base class. The class we inherit from.
-Subclass is the class that inherits

Rules:
-Yes to multiple layers of inheritance
-No multiple inheritance -> you can't extend more than one class



Everything extends an object:
-11 methods
-toString() - a string representation of the object
-equals() - True if the parameter is the same as the base
-getClass() - gets the string representation of the class name
