Inheritance 2.0

You should always instantiate members in the superclass in the superclass.

How to access members in a superclass:
-Make them public
-Use getters and setters
-Make them protected
--"public" to subclasses
--"public" to other classes in the same package

super.X()
-tells Java to call method X in the superclass first

@Override
-Java annotation (that's fancy speak for meta-data)
-It does not change how the code behaves
-It just a help for programmers
-Standard practice

Polymorphism
-it means we treat subclasses of different types as if they were all the supertype.
